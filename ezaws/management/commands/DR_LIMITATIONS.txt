from an AWS Regions to another one, using another AWS Account if necessary.

The scripts are mainly base on copies of snapshots and recreation of EC2 instances usings
semantic tags associated to the Snapshots.

You must make sure that :

1- the target Region has at least as many AZ as the original one

2- if default limits of AWS resources usage have been increased in the original Region
   make sure the same limits have been raised in the target Region
